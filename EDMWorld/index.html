                        <p>Walker was originally known as DJ Walkzz. Since he has been a part of many different producing groups, he later became just sWalkzz. He ended up using his real name, Alan Walker, as his artist name. The recognisable logo consists of intertwined letters A and W, the initials of his name, was designed by Walker himself in 2013. He also uses a hoodie and face mask resembling the concept of black bloc on stage to create the rest of the image.</p>
						<p>At the very beginning, we were thinking about ideas like how can we promote Alan Walker as an artist, and then we created a symbol that's kind of almost attach anyone. Therefore, you can just have the hoodie and the mask and you immediately become a 'Walker'. That's also a sign of no matter who you are, you can be a 'Walker', we're all equal. Walker explained the concept of his look, in an interview by KKBox.</p>

                        <p>Trevor Dahl previously recorded music under the name Plug In Stereo. Prior to the 2014 formation of the trio, Trevor and Matt lived together and later wrote and recorded music with Kevin. Their name was inspired by Kevin's brother who told him that he had found the cheat code to getting anything he wanted in life. We really embody the idea that anything is possible. To us, the real 'cheat code' to life is loving what you do and we hope to convey that energy through our music, they said in an interview.</p>
                        <p>In June 2016, they released Let Me Hold You (Turn Me On) with Dante Klein, which samples Kevin Lyttle's song Turn Me On. The song has since gained over 100 million streams.

                        <p>Marshmello wears a custom helmet for public appearances. His identity is unknown. It has been frequently suggested that Marshmello is American DJ Christian Comstock, also known as Dotcom, whose style is similar to Marshmello's. Skrillex also referred to Marshmello as "Chris" in an interview. In addition, both are managed by Moe Shalizi and allegedly have the same tattoo and birthday.</p>
                        <p>His musical style includes groove-oriented, synth and bass-heavy electronic dance music. Inspired by other masked DJs like Deadmau5 and Daft Punk, Marshmello appears wearing a full-head-covering white coloured bucket. Despite the anonymity, his career received international recognition in 2015 when he began releasing tracks online, including remixes of Zedd's Beautiful Now, Jack U's Where Are U Now and others, as well as his own single Alone.</p>
